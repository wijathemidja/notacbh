notacbh is a way to play games locally on pretty much any chrome book.
notacbh uses ChromeOS' Penguin which is basically Debian.
through this we can just use it like Debian.
notacbh aims to make installation of apps ez for non Linux users.
it is called notacbh because it is exactly that - not a chrome book hack - it just installs software.
maybe one day I'll work out how to make a .deb
notacbhb (base cbh) installs the essentials 
N-snake
Chromium
Dolphin
gnome-2048
these packages have already been essential to my life and others must experience it
