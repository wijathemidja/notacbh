notacbh is a way to play games locally on pretty much any chrome book.
notacbh uses ChromeOS' Penguin which is basically Debian.
through this we can just use it like Debian.
notacbh aims to make installation of apps ez for non Linux users.
it is called notacbh because it is exactly that - not a chrome book hack - it just installs software.
maybe one day I'll work out how to make a .deb
notacbh packages below

notacbh (Essential) - chromium, dolphin
notacbhb (Base) - chromium, dolphin, nsnake, gnome-2048
notacbhp (Plus) - chromium, dolphin, nsnake, gnome
notacbhd (Dev) - chromium, dolphin, firefox, vscode
notacbha (All) - chromium, dolphin, vscode, firefox, gnome, nsnake
nptacbhg (Games) - nsnake, gnome-2048, gnome-chess,

these packages have already been essential to my life and others must experience it
